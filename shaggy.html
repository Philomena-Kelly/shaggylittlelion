In this page I will explain the wonderful world in which Shaggy calls home, what he is and especially his special calling as a Nymph, who he is as an individual, and who I am as the applicant.</p>
<p>I would suggest to read the page in the order it is presented for clarity of what it's all about. However, you can skip or skim sections if you prefer. The first section also has a "too long didn't read" segment at the end for convenience's sake. So, sit back, relax, grab some water (because hydration is important), and prepare to be immersed into the captivating world of <b>Blume</b>.

The body is the vessel, but the spirit is the essence. Most creatures, however, cannot perceive spirits except for in very subtle ways. Some of the most prominent but unseen spirits are those that dwell in forests, plants, and trees.
</p><p>
Some spirits have humanoid appearance while others have animalistic ones, or a mix of the two. Many even have completely different and almost alien appearances, while the more powerful spirits can change their appearance altogether. Most smaller or newer spirits have no form at all and instead appear to be small amorphous blobs. These are usually very simple minded and playful, much like children.
</p><p>
There are in general four classes of spirit: <b>Minor Spirits</b> whose physical occupancy is usually something very small and seemingly insignificant such as patches of grass or moss. <b>Lesser Spirits</b> Which are usually smaller plants which last only a short amount of time such as dandelions or clovers. <b>Greater Spirits</b> are the spirits of most other plants like trees, bushes, and ferns. They are often wiser and more in touch with this realty than the lower two, especially once they are aged. Finally, <b>Major Spirits</b> are ancient being who instead of being attached to a single plant, are attached to several, such as a forest. They are stoic and wise creatures and are often sought out by spiritualists.
</p><p><img src="http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/163/4/3/one_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4j0e.png" class="right">
<b>Nymphs</b> are spirits, usually Major or Greater, chosen by the fates to watch over forests in all that the forest might need. They are required to help all those who enter their forest who are in need of assistance, which includes plant spirits which reside their. The Nymphs must settle every dispute, no matter how difficult or how small, or the balance of the forest will be thrown off.
</p><p>
If the balance of the Forest is altered the plants and spirits which live there become wilted, despondent, and even altogether hostile. Although a forest can survive without balance, it will not thrive nor will it be a source of much life-if any.
</p><p><img src="http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/163/b/8/eleven_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4j1s.png" class="left">
If a Nymph leaves their forest for any period of time longer than maybe an hour, the forest's condition begins to decrease. If the Nymph keeps leaving, the forest will often grow in a mangled mess and lose its natural appearance, instead morphing into something which appearance is so disturbing it seems that it lacks a heart.
</p><p>
Since the Nymph was first a plant spirit, they remain connected to their plant of origin throughout the time that they are a Nymph. Like any other spirits, if the plant is injured or dies, the spirits does so in turn. Most Nymph's plants are stronger, larger, and older things such as Trees or sturdy bushes, however that is not always the case.
</p><p><img src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/163/2/4/three_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4iyn.png" class="right">
When people need help, they often find their way to the forests in which Nymphs dwell, sometimes by accident and sometimes by design. They seek help for everything ranging from health problems to relationships to even money problems, and the Nymph is required to help in any way that they can. To the people that seek them out, Nymphs are like benevolent gods and are often worshiped by them, given offerings, etc.
</p><p>
Most Nymphs do not or cannot feel physical or romantic attraction to others, though there are a few exceptions. Deep platonic relations with mortals are discouraged especially in "newer" nymphs, because as the mortal starts aging and comes close to their death, the nymph might be tempted to prolong their lives much longer than the fates intend. Any meddling with the fates' plans are strictly forbidden and can end with the offender's execution or some other horrible punishment.</p>



<img src="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/165/6/3/sad_plant_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7mee8p.png" width="400"><br><i><b>One of the most difficult duties of a Nymph is to tell a dying plant that it is dying and to ease them in their passing. This can be particularly trying for Nymphs, however it is extremely important.</b></i>

<h2>tl;dr:</h2>
<div class="smalli">

<p>
Every living thing is a spirit with a body, however most cannot see pure spirits. All plants have some spirit, whether it be small and unaware of its surroundings or great and wise. Nymphs are spirits chosen by the fates to look after forests and everything inside them, including the plants and spirits there as well as travelers passing through. </p>
<p>The Nymphs have to stay inside their forest at all times, and must also only help people to the extent which the fates allow. Any deviation from the fates' plans can result in harsh punishment.</p>

<div class="med"><img src="http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/182/7/a/story_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7ou75e.png" class="header">
<p>A young kougra wandered aimlessly through the strange forest with nothing but the clothes on her back and a flower in her hair. She could have sworn that she had seen that tree before-but she would have remembered that bush-right? She bit the inside of her cheeks worriedly and thought briefly of turning back.
</p><p><img src="http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/181/d/6/c_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7on5dt.png" class="right">
This had been the farthest she ever was from home, but she couldn't go back there, not now. She didn't belong there and she knew it, they all knew it, but then again, she didn't really belong here either. She sighed and carried on; it wasn't like she would be able to even find her way back anyways. 
</p><p>
She tried to focus on where she was going, but her thoughts kept wandering to everything else. She trudged on through the woods, her usually cheerful demeaned soured by her situation. Before she knew it, she felt a drops of water on her forehead, and then another, and another, and then several more all at once.
</p><p><img src="http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/181/0/9/d_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7on5dn.png" class="left">
Before she got soaked she darted under the enormous leaf of what appeared to be an overgrown weed, but there was something very comforting about it. She glanced around and for the first time, she realized how strange the forest had become. What had been normal trees at the beginning of the woods became enormous plants. While plain foliage had littered the forest when she first entered it, now its floor was covered in plants and leaves which she had never seen before, in shade of blues, purples, and greens.
</p><p>
She sat against the trunk-er, <i>stem</i>-and hugged her knees, taking in everything that had happened that day. She began again to get lost in her own thoughts, the wonders of the mysterious forest left behind in a trail of confusion.
</p><p>
<b>Are you okay?</b> Came a voice from beside her.
</p><p>
She turned suddenly looked at the speaker with mild shock. A peculiar look yurble stood under a nearby tree-plant thing, giving her a concerned look. He was short and round with a large mop of fur covering his head, shoulders and back. She gave him a blank stare. <b>What?</b>
</p><p>
<b>You, are you okay?</b> He asked again, tilting his head sideways.
</p><p>
<b>Um..</b> She though about her answer for a moment and shrugged <b>I guess so</b>
</p><p>
He raised an eyebrow and tilted his head a little more <b>But you're all wet.</b>
</p><p>
She sighed <b>Yeah...you're kind of right there.</b> She brushed some water off her arm and looked at him, mirroring his head tilt <b>Don't suppose you have any great ideas?</b>
</p><p>
He smiled and nodded his head to the right <b>I know a place.</b></p>

<p><b>I don't even know you..</b> she said, skeptical of his offer.</p>

<p><b>Me? Oh, my name is Shaggy</b> He stuck out a chubby hand to her and gave a broad smile.</p>



<h2>Conclusion,</h2>
<div class="smalli">

<p>After their initial meeting, Shaggy and the girl, who happens to be my character Pure (more about her later), go to a very large plant that is one of the things in the forest that closest resembles and actual tree. There is a decent sized hollow inside where Shaggy has set up his home, complete with small trinkets, baubles, and various other items.</p>
<p>Once the storm clears up and Pure is just about ready to leave, Shaggy gives her whatever supplies he can-fruits mostly-and tells her to head in a different direction she was initially traveling. She questions this but only briefly and then takes his advice.</p>
<p>Because she took his advice, she finds something more valuable than what she was originally looking for. She finds two others who need a home in their life as much as she does, and through each other they find it.</p>
(it's 100% as cheesy as it sounds)

<br><b>Species:</b> Forest Nymph/Major Spirit.
<br><b>Gender:</b> Male
<br><b>Personality:</b> Kind, carefree, and flighty. Kindness comes as a second nature to him and he only ever tries to help people. However he is easily distracted and often not very good with verbal advice, which often leads to people becoming impatient with him.
<br><b>About his character:</b> 
<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Shaggy is a Nymph with dominion over <i>Candlewood Forest</i>, a unique forest composed of enormous tree-sized plants. He stays there, gladly accepting his responsibility to the forest and awaiting people to seek him out for help. Many people find their way into the forest, and in gratitude for his help, they often give him small inexpensive gifts, as he would accept nothing more. </p>
<p>He collects these items and puts them in the little place he calls him. It is a naturally hollowed out tree-like plant with enough space for him to live in comfortably. The plant is his plant, the one his spirit is connected to. It bears large fruits which he gives to people in need of cures or things along those lines.</p>

<br><p><b>One of his closest companions</b> is a Kimbi whom he found injured one day. After helping the creature back to health, they never left and now spend much of their time following Shaggy around the forest. In my world, creatures like the Kimbi aren't born or hatched, but rather blumed from flowers. Because of this and other reasons, they have no biological genders.</p>

<p class="smallR"><b>Clean vs Sloppy:</b> 
Living in the wild, Shaggy doesn't necessarily have the need to be clean, but he tries to make the forest as happy as possible, and a clean forest is a happy forest.
</p>
<p class="smallL"><b>Nice vs Mean:</b>
Shaggy by nature is very kind and caring, and wouldn't hurt a fly. Even if someone is a bad egg, he'll try to treat him like he would anyone else.<br>
</p>
<p class="smallR"><b>Open vs Reserved:</b>
Although he helps everyone else with their problems, he doesn't often open up himself. As he has to take care of everyone in the forest, there is hardly anyone to "take care" of him. sad :c
</p>
<p class="smallL"><b>Leader vs Follower:</b> 
Shaggy is much more of a leader, as he has to be when taking care of so many creatures. however, being hard does not come easily to him and he will often let people get away with things.
</p>
<p class="smallR"><b>Outgoing vs Shy:</b> 
Shaggy has very little problems talking to people, animals, or and spirits and in consequence is easily outgoing. However he can get a little cranky after a busy day, but he tries not to take it out on people.
</p>
<p class="smallL"><b>Creative vs Boring:</b> 
In helping people he often gives them different fruit, different advice, and different metaphors to try and assist them in the way which would be right for them.<br><br>
</p>
<p class="smallR"><b>Hardworking vs Lazy:</b> 
Shaggy does his job and does it well, hardly ever skimping on responsibilities. However, he does get tired and is prone to taking naps at inopportune times.
</p>
<p class="smallL"><b>Careful vs Impulsive:</b> 
Often with small tasks he goes with his gut and acts on his first instinct, however is the gravity of the situation is great he does take more time to consider other options.
</p>
<p class="smallR"><b>Relaxed vs Tense:</b> 
As Candlewood forest hardly ever has very difficult problems, and as Shaggy can usually fix any that do arrive, he seems very relaxed and carefree with very little worry.
</p>
<p class="smallL"><b>Intelligent vs Dull:</b>  
While not necessarily knowledgeable about a lot of things, Shaggy understands things quickly and is able to catch on to difficult concepts and issues with ease.

It is a large and expansive place filled with forest, mountains, valleys, oceans, and floating islands. It is full of color and magic and mystery, largely untouched by modern science and society. The people their live in clusters and tribes ranging from fifty to over a thousand people each, all with their own customs, culture and beliefs.</p>

<p>Although the peoples are so divided, there is hardly any wars that go on between them. Each group has their own large area of land, and are slightly hostile when others go onto it, but minor scuffles are usually the extent of the violence. There is often trades and business done between groups and many trading posts throughout the world.</p>

<p>The people don't just differ in culture or customs, however, but also in appearance and even species. Their is much diversity between and even within groups that it would be impossible to list them all. Their a several major and interesting places around the world, such as The Planes, The Forest of The Eternal Night, The Skylands, and Candlewood Forest, just to name a few.</p>


<br><br><br><img src="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/165/4/8/grasslands_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7me4fq.png"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/TLB/Resources/d47.png">
<p>The Planes are far too many and too broad to all be completely covered under one section, so be aware that these are the most common things in the planes, and definitely not the rule. The planes are vast and expansive areas of land which can spread for miles across. Many tribes and peoples call these place "home", however the most common are the Kaus, a fiercely independent but un-aggressive group.
</p><p>
They are mostly well built and well equipped to face dangers, however they are primarily vegetarians. They are very family-centric and protective over the young and will even take in other species' abandoned children. They Live in crude huts or caves if tribes of up to thirty individuals, though it is not uncommon for their to be more.</p>

Most of them however are not populated by tribes but individual small groups or families. However, there is an exception; an unusually large conglomeration of Islands which float high above most others is home to a civilization of mostly tige-rlike winged people, however there are a few purely bird like people who also call this place home.
</p><p>
They're position in Blume represents what they feel is their position in life-above everyone else, constantly looking down at the world below. They have high standards for beauty, strength, and intelligence and do not accept anything less. They hardly trade or make commerce with the other tribes because they feel that they are below them and do not need anything they might have to offer.</p>

The inhabitants range from evil wizards to <i>cursed wanderer</i>, travelers looking for a God and those trying to hide from One.</p>
<p>The forest is thick and mysterious, giving off an unwelcoming air about it. From its dense underbrush to the bioluminescent plants and creatures that call it home, it is far from familiar to most people. There are no known tribes which live within it, so there isn't any sort of definitive culture of the inhabitants. However, a tribe of doglike people live the closest to it, and occasionally make trips into the forest for various reasons.</p>
<p>The Nymph of the forest is an indifferent and callous spirit, wanting nothing to do with the forest in their care. They often leave it for long periods of time, causing the plant's spirits to rely on themselves for what they need. This contributes to the forest's air of unwelcomingness. The Nymph helps people with matters of a darker nature than most, such as revenge or violence.</p>

<i>Candlewood Forest</i> is a mystical place full of larger-than-life plants. One of the most interesting places in Blume, it's definitely one worth a visit. With many plants and animals completely unique to the forest, it is a one of a kind place.</p><p>The Nymphs there have been constantly kind to the forest, and according to some native mythology, that's the reason it became so immense. It is believed to have started from a small and unimportant field of weeds, but the Nymph which at the time looked after it showed it so much love that with the love, the size of the plants exploded. But that is of course only rumor, right?

Because he's unconverted, I would not be able to do as much as I would like, however I think that I've come to a nice balance of simple and interesting in the above customization. Plus, I think it really fits his world and setting. 
</p>
<img src="http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/165/e/0/goldtrophy_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7mdqph.png" class="left"><p>
If I am chosen as his owner, I do plan on entering him into the Beauty Contest. I try and enter often, but due to real life priorities I don't get around to it as often as I would like. But, I have racked up a few trophies here and there from when I do enter, and you can see examples of this with <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=ieften">Ieften</a>, <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=treecup">Treecup</a>, and <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Biotoxin">Biotoxin</a>.  Plus a trophy or two would look super neat next to him on a lookup C:
</p>
<p>
Shaggy would at first get a simple petlookup like <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Glade">Glade's</a> or possibly along the lines of  <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Fairydust">Fairydust's</a> which of course would have a fitting background for him and a paragraph or two on his world and character. In time, I plan on giving him one of my more complex ones like I did with <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=ieften">Ieften</a>, <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=contaminated">Nate</a>, and <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Seraphinyan">Seraphinyan</a> unique to him and more fitting of his personality and setting. 
</p>
<p>
An edited version of this page will be used as his petpage, though I will keep adding to it and developing on his character even after that. He will also find a place on my portfolio page (linked a few sections below this one) with the rest of my characters, along with a section about him, more information, and roleplay settings and statuses.

I plan on giving him a Kimbi, and I'm not going to lie, it's mostly because they look absolutely adorable with him. I have a very simple story which would tie in the little guy to Shaggy, which I plan on writing and entering into the petpet spotlight like I did with <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=ieften">Ieften</a> and his Sklyde.
</p>
<p>
Small sketches, writings, and doodles of him would continue to fill my sketchbooks and notebooks as they do now, though many of them won't ever see the light of the internet, however they are just as important to me as those that do. I will continue to expand Candlewood Forest and the rest of the world of Blume, both online and off.

Now, the thought process of young and inexperienced me was "I have a real word now, I can trade for anything!" and consequently offered on every Unconverted, Draik, and Krawk I laid my eyes on. Though my spree of offering is all a blur now, one of the pets which I had offered on stuck in the back of my mind, and that pet was <b>Shaggylittlelion</b>. <i>The other was a magma draik named Firedragon1, but this is not an application for Firedragon1. If it were, I'd have gone with a completely different color scheme.</i>

</p>
<p><img src="http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/163/b/d/two_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4iyj.png" class="right">Every time I saw Shaggy Up For Trade after that, I settled back to admire from afar and silently wish that he'd end up in a splendid permanent home. Some part of me wanted to own him, to have him as my own, but the other part of me realized that my french real word was probably one of the worst offers the pet had ever gotten.
</p>

<p><img src="http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/163/0/5/nine_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4j0m.png" class="left"> I have always admired UC Faerie Yurbles. Everything about them screamed adorable to me-the colors, the fluidity, and the pose especially. Holding their cute little foots with an adorable smile. They always stuck out to me as undoubtedly one of the best UC faeries, although I never had felt strongly about them enough to get one.</p>

<p>That is, until I saw Shaggy UFA. His name, the colors, the timing-everything was perfect. Everything clicked and before I knew it, I was getting excited to make the app. I was designing pages and writing stories and I was finally inspired by a pet again.</p>

<br><img src="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/163/b/b/inspiration_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4tu4.png" class="header"><p>Shaggy's design, character, and the entirety of Candlewood Forest bloomed (pun <i>completely</i> intended) from many ideas which previously had been wandering aimlessly throughout my mind. However, once I had the opportunity to have a chance at owning Shaggy, everything came together into and orbital system revolving around the precious conglomeration of pixels. </p>

<img src="http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/175/2/4/colorpalette_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7nt7as.png"><p>I mainly based his design off of his neopets form, however I took additional inspiration for his physical shape from Panda Bears, Bumble Bees, and Moon Bears <i>(AKA Asian Black Bears, but "moon bears" is such a cute name).</i> As I <i>love</i> his existing color scheme, I tweaked it only slightly slightly to make it a bit more pastel as I felt it fit better with his design. I feel like although it's different, his design still retains the adorable essence found in his neopets form.</p>

Although I've had my concept for Nymphs for a very long time now, I really feel that brainstorming Shaggy's character really helped me solidify and further develop the mythology.</p>
<img src="http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/163/0/9/terrarium_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4iyu.png"><img src="http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/163/a/2/plantsinajar_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4j08.png"><img src="http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/163/c/6/cottonjar_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4j20.png"><p>The concept of the fictional Candlewood Forest is drawn heavily from my very real passion and love for plants. When I was in third grade, I was given an assignment in science to make a terrarium, the concept of which was at first a mystery. And enclosed biom full of a completely stable and self sufficient ecosystem-including plants and insects-all in a jar which required little to no maintenance. I was enthralled by the idea and made several of these miniworlds which sustained themselves for some time. In fact, I still own the very first one I made-in a large Utz party-mix jar, although it has gone through many overhauls and changes. Currently, my windowsills are home to countless-okay, maybe you can count them, but there are a lot-potted plants, terrariums, and even a collection of pet slugs and snails.</p>
<img src="http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/163/1/0/fourteen_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4j0w.png"><img src="http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/163/f/5/eight_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4j1v.png"><img src="http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/163/5/1/ten_by_enginefangirl4ever-d7m4iz4.png"><p>All this may seem unconnected from Shaggy or Candlewood, but in truth this inspired the entirety of the Forest. The wonder and beauty of these plants-and nature in general-is what inspired Candlewood, a forest full of plants that people in the real world might normally pass over as weeds blown up to of enormous, larger-than-life proportions to show just how magnificent they can be.

Below are a selection of pages which I have dedicated my time, effort, and talent to for countless hours of my life. These pages are my pride and joy, and probably what I love most about neopets. Many of them may be incomplete or not perfect or outdated, but I assure you I am determined to complete each and every one of them. It is because of neopets that I know what a css is and how to add images into pages, how I learned to roleplay and develop my original characters, and how I got my love of webcomics. I hope that through these pages, you're able to see how much I love working on this site and my characters and how enthusiastic I am about it all.</p>

<p>First of all, I want to thank <i>Ina</i> for  putting Shaggy UFA and giving me this chance to develop not only his character but an entire world. Throughout this app I learned and figured out so many things about Blume and Nymphs, and it gave me that creative boost that I'm always looking for. I had an incredibly fun time working on this page and I know I'll always look back on it fondly.

Second, I want to thank <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=manliestofmen">Sal</a> for constant support, advice, and pushing me to get off my butt and make this app. I couldn't do it without you. Well I could actually, but it wouldn't be half as cool. Also for redrawing Pure's flower about fifteen times because I'm far too picky for my own good. You're the best man. <strike>Second best actually, only championed by me.</strike>
</p><p>
Third I want to thank my guild <i>Catching Galaxies</i> and the App and Character Chats for encouraging and motivating me to finish. Especially <b>Awk</b> and <b>Sidd</b> for encouraging me and helping me through various problems, even if we're supposed to be mortal enemies in this process. You guys rock.</p>
